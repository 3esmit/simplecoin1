  <p> A “simple stablecoin” (see <a target=_blank
  href=https://github.com/makerdao/simple-stablecoin>makerdao/simple-stablecoin</a>)
  is one type of stablecoin which can be run by an individual,
  organization, or even a <a target=_blank
  href=https://ryepdx.github.io/the-tao/>The TAO</a>.

  <p> It uses a reduced ETH collateral model controlled by an owner
  address.  In the simplest case, stablecoin holders have no
  protections against the owner, but constraints can be encoded in the
  owner as a contract.

  <p> Some example failure modes: never refreshing the price (getting
  locked out of the contract, losing the key, etc.); setting a bad a
  price (or “insider trading”); withdrawing too much ETH.  There are
  many different ways to handle these failure modes, but this code
  must be decided on and written by each contract owner.  Or,
  <a href=http://intheoreum.org>just trust Bob</a>.

  <p> The code is as simple as possible to reduce the cost of
  independent verification.  It is just a building block that needs to
  be carefully constrained.  It is also completely unsuitable for
  maintaining price stability at scale, besides also being unsuitable
  for any purpose in general.

  <p> The idea is to give potential
  <a href=http://feedbase.io>oracles</a>,
  <a href=https://github.com/nexusdev/keeper>keepers</a> and
  <a href=https://github.com/makerdao/maker-market>market</a>
  <a href=https://github.com/makerdao/maker-market-matcher>makers</a>
  something to do while Maker’s stablecoin engine
  undergoes refinement.
