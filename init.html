  <p> A “simple stablecoin” (see <a target=_blank
  href=https://github.com/makerdao/simple-stablecoin>makerdao/simple-stablecoin</a>)
  is one type of stablecoin which can be run by an individual, organization,
  or even a <a target=_blank href=https://ryepdx.github.io/the-tao/>The
  TAO</a>.

  <p> It uses a reduced ETH collateral model controlled by an owner address.
  In the simplest case, stablecoin holders have no protections against the
  owner, but constraints can be encoded in the owner as a contract.

  <p> Some example failure modes: never refreshing the price (getting locked
  out of the contract, losing the key, etc.); setting a bad a price (or
  “insider trading”); withdrawing too much ETH.  There are many different
  ways to handle these failure modes, but this code must be decided on and
  written by each contract owner.  Or, <a target=_blank
  href=http://intheoreum.org>just trust Bob</a>.

  <p> The code is as simple as possible to reduce the cost of independent
  verification.  It is just a building block that needs to be carefully
  constrained.  It is also completely unsuitable for maintaining price
  stability at scale, besides also being unsuitable for any purpose
  in general.

  <p> The idea is to give potential <a target=_blank
  href=http://feedbase.io>oracles</a>, <a target=_blank
  href=https://github.com/nexusdev/keeper>keepers</a> and <a target=_blank
  href=https://github.com/makerdao/maker-market>market</a> <a target=_blank
  href=https://github.com/makerdao/maker-market-matcher>makers</a> something
  to do while Maker’s stablecoin engine undergoes refinement.
